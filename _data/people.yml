A major part of his work applies satellite remote sensing and coastal modeling to characterize nearshore dynamics. He conducts coastal validation of L3 and L4 altimetry products (SWOT, CryoSat-2, and CMEMS) and runs high-resolution tropical-cyclone simulations with an atmospheric model, using its outputs to drive a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. This workflow enables process-based assessments of tropical-cyclone contributions to sea-level extremes and evaluations of the skill of coastal sea-level products."
